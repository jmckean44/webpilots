						Even as web technologies evolve and AI continues to transform the industry, the fundamentals of web development largely remain unchanged. Core principles such as clean and semantic HTML,
						accessible and user-friendly design, performance optimization, and clear communication are still essential.
					</p>
					<p>We keep the foundations of the development process in mind - without loosing site of the end goal and what is required to get there.</p>
					<p>No office. No foosball tables. We cut our lawns at lunch and walk our dogs between zoom meetings.</p>
